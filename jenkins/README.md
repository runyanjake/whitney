# Jenkins

A Jenkins instance for whitney. Sort of an open ended project, figure that i'll find something to do with it once it's set up.

Followed instructions at `https://dev.to/andresfmoya/install-jenkins-using-docker-compose-4cab` 

Note container name is different so actual command to get one time admin pw, etc is `docker exec jenkins_whitney cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
